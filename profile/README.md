## Overview

We are a team of six friends with a shared passion for building thoughtful and intelligent technology. With skills spanning front-end and back-end development, UI/UX design, AI/ML, database systems, and applied physics, we bring diverse perspectives to every problem—and the drive to solve them.  
We love the challenge of taking an idea and bringing it to life.
